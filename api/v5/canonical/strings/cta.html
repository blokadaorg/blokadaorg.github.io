<h4>Blokada 4.4 and Keybase</h4>

<p>We have some great news: Blokada 4.4 is just released, and the update is rolling out to everyone now. If you have any problems updating, and you installed Blokada from our website (and not playstore or fdroid), <a href="https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada/releases/download/4.4.2/blokada-v4.4.2.apk">try tapping this link</a> to download the update directly. 

<p>As you might be already aware, Blokada is also available on the end-to-end encrypted communication platform, Keybase. We want to invite you to use this platform as we believe it's great for privacy oriented users, and it's free.</p>

<p>The other great news is that the <b>Airdrop</b> is about to happen on Keybase. You can receive an equivalent of around $30 to spend on whatever you want - for example on Blokada Tunnel (our new VPN service).</p>

<p>Interested? Let's have a chat: <a href="https://keybase.io/team/blokadaorg.public">tap here</a>.</p>
